# Enigma-Machine-Web-Server

A project I did in Java, html, css and Java Script for a Java and web development course in my Bsc.
in order to deploy the server, clone or take artifacts and put in a tomcat webapp directory.
there are many configurations via xml files that need to be properly understood, but in order to play with the server,
you can just use the ex3 xml׳s.

if you want only to use the machine than clone the EnigmaMachine module and use the ex1 xml׳s.

for further information please contact through mail.
