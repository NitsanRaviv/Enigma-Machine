# Enigma-Machine-Web-Server

A project I did for Java course in my Bsc.
in order to use, clone or take artifacts to tomcat folder.
there are many configurations via xml files that need to be properly understood, but in order to play you in the server,
you can just use the ex3 xml׳s.

if you want only to use the machine than clone the EnigmaMachine module and use the ex1 xml׳s.

fur further information please contact through mail.
